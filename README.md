# String uwufier in brainfuck
*did I genuenly spent a day on this?*
## Description
Uwufier makes your text look more like.. uwu.. idk. It essentially replaces all instances
of the characters `l`,`r`,`L` and `R` with the letter `w` - hence it is a simple search and replace program
## Usage
Just put the text into standart input lol. The output is displayed in standard output.
## Note
This program often prints a null terminator, which is normally invisible, however some interpreters, notably 
[tio.run](https://tio.run/#brainfuck) print nonprintable characters with that unicode missing square. Hence, I recommend
you use the [El Brainfuck](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) interpreter or the [minond.xyz](https://minond.xyz/brainfuck/)
